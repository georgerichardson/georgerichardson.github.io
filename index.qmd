Hi. This site is mainly a place for my blog to live, but also has some other information about myself and my work and other bits and pieces that might interest you, depending on what you're into.

For the last few years, I've worked as a data scientist or a leader of data science and engineering teams, creating research and applications with social impact aims. I've also run various other projects, such as a DIY bike workshop and a community garden.

I'm interested in the intersections of science and technology, ecological and social issues, strategy and left/socialist politics. Although, I would class myself as an expert in none of those things.


You can also find me on [X/Twitter](https://x.com/g_r_richardson), [GitHub](https://github.com/georgerichardson) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/george-richardson-45846931a/). This website is made with [Quarto](https://quarto.org/).
